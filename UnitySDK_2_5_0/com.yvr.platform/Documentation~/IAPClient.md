YVR Payment is a current payment system based on YVR account system. The payment settlement is done by YVR's game currency (Y coin). Users will need to enter YVR user centre to top-up their account.

## Debug API

> [!Important] 
> The platform service status needs to be **Published** when calling the IAP related APIs.

1. When the app has not yet been submitted (draft), developer creates platform services in the Management Center, the developer can use the App ID and API Name to invoke the platform services.
2. When the app is updated and the developer creates a new platform service in the Management Center, the developer can use the App ID and API Name to invoke the platform service in the new version without affecting the online version.
<br />

**Note**: When the app is uploaded and the platform service is published (Add-on content in app store is turned on), the add-on content will be displayed and sold in the store. You will need to turn off Add-on content in app store during the debugging phase.
